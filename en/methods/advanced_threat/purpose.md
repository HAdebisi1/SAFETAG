It’s very common to find suspicious behaviors, processes, traffic and ‘weird activities’ on a computer device during a SAFETAG audit ether rising up the issue by auditees or by discovering it yourself. You have to know that investigating a machine during the audit might not be a good option with the limited amount of time you have.

Most of the times, such doubts are ‘False flag’ related to other non-malicious software causing the machine to act weird or other type of less serious malicious software like adware.

Due the limited window of time, the auditor will focus on identifying malicious activates, collect evidences, running basic analysis, assessing the risk, damage, then submit the binaries for more in depth analysis.
