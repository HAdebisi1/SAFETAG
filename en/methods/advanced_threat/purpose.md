It is very common to find suspicious behaviors, processes, traffic and other ‘weird activities’ during a SAFETAG audit. SAFETAG practitioners should always be on the lookout for suspicious activities as they apply other SAFETAG methods and their activities, from interactions and discussions with staff to hands-on device assessment and traffic analysis.

Due to the limited window of time, the auditor should focus on identifying suspicious activities and triaging them rapidly. Many of these will be false positives related to other non-malicious software causing the machine to act weird or (most commonly) other type of less serious (and non-targeted) malicious software like adware.  When this cannot be ruled out, collecting evidence, running basic analysis, and assessing the risk and impact against organizational priorities will help prioritize further action. In-depth binary analysis is usually best kept for post-audit work during the reporting and follow-up phases.
