* **Adversary Capability Assessment** - This likely should be an output from the context research work. Are there Advance Persistent Threats which should be taken in to account? How do they operate? Are there known IOCs to look for?
* **Analyzing Specific Suspicious Events/Activities** - If the organization have specific concerns or evidence suggesting a targeted attack, the auditor can focus attention to match them against any known attacks or flag them for further research.
* **Threat Hunting** - If the organization suspect that they have been compromised, but does not have any specific, suspicious device/process/email, the auditor can leverage techniques to intelligently spend their time to investigate further.
* **In-Depth Analysis** - If malware is discovered, but cannot be identified, further analysis will be necessary. This may also trigger a change in assessment scope and/or an incident response approach.
