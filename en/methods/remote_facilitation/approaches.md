* **Approach 1, hybrid online/synchronous**
Can be used with large group of participants, where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.

* **Approach 2, hybrid offline/asynchronous**
Can be used with large group of participants, where it is not possible to meet over video chat.

* **Approach 3, multiple small sessions**
Consists of multiple small full sessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to assure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible to conduct multiple small video chats.

* **Approach 4, on-site facilitator**
Suitable for when there is a person that can take a facilitation role on-site, while the auditor is over video chat. Facilitator does not have to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more participants per session than Approach 3 per session.
