Selecting the most suitable approach requires understanding of organisational and personnel capacity of the organisation, including supported communication technologies, and the availability of someone that can assist in facilitation. After selecting the most suitable approach, auditor should make sure to prepare for remote facilitation as per the preparation section above.

The selected approach can be used to adapt Data Assessment, Process Mapping, and Threat Assessment exercises to be conducted remotely.

### Approach 1, hybrid online/synchronous
Can be used with large group of participants, where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.

  * As a starting point, an introductory video chat is recommended as a starting point, this allows the auditor to introduce themselves, the exercise, and agree on communication rules. This will help in building rapport, and address any concerns participants may have, as well as allow for further testing of communication channel.
  * The auditor ask participants to fill in a template or survey to collect information needed, this stems directly from the activity, whether it is data assessment, process mapping, threat analysis, or any activity requiring facilitation.
  * Participants send their input to auditor, either through answering into and online questionnaire, or through any other media agreed on.
  * Auditor collect the information and arrange them for analysis and discussion.
  * Another video chat is conducted to discuss responses and expand and validate on information collected through the survey.
  * Follow up sessions may be arranged with selected groups of staff as needed.
