**Verify Target**

Before performing DNS enumeration, make sure that you have the right target URL/s. This is to avoid scanning out-of-scope targets. Verify with the organization that you have the right target. 

**DNS enumeration types**

**Passive**

Passive technique, or "indirect" approach refers to the enumeration process that doesn't send any traffic or packets from your machine, directly to your target. This can be done using 3rd tools such as online tools and cloud based scanners.

**Active**

Active technique, or "direct" approach refers to sending DNS queries and enumeration tests directly to the target. Consider that traffic is send over the target which may leave traces or traffic logs coming from your source IP.

**DNS results Documentation**

Managing your enumeration results can help you in later preparation for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, or reporting and documentation. An organized report will be easier to read and to compile, and also can be used for presentation and PoC (Proof of Concepts) in the future.
