DNS Stands for Domain Name Service. All in all, what it does is translate hosts/computer's name into it's IP address. It provides a way to know the IP address of any given machine on the internet, consider it as telephone directory.

Recursive and Iterative DNS Queries:
In Recursive DNS query, the client needs an answer from the DNS server - either it can answer the query or give an error message saying it can't find what it's looking for. The queried host/server must do whatever it takes to find the answer - even to query other servers until it gets an information, otherwise it will fail.

In Iterative way, it basically asks the server for an answer IF, the server knows it. If not, it will get a "referral" which is the name of the server that may  have the answer (an authoritative server at a lower level in the hierchical structure. (example image).

DNS enumeration is your initial step in performing DNS Security Assessment. Upon completion of this assessment stage, you find issues regarding vulnerabilities to DNS cache poisioning, DNS ID Hacking, DNS spoofing.
