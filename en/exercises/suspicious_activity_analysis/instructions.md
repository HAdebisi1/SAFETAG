In the following, you should look for files and URLs that may indicate a compromise and may help you identify an infection. These sections often are highly interrelated - a phishing email may include malicious URLs and/or files, network traffic may include URLs, URLs may try to send malicious file downloads.

**Questions to ask the user / organization**

* What suspicious behaviors are you witnessing?
* Where and when are you seeing this behavior? What makes you feel that the machine is somehow infected?
* Do you have an alternative to this machine/process/account you can use it until we clear things up?
* Did you receive any suspicious or unexpected email, attachment or different form of communication that made you feel this way?
* Do you still have access to the original email, attachment or any form of communication?
