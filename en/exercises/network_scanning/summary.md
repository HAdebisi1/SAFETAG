Network scanning is a technique used to gather information about devices connected on a certain network. It usually involves enumerating port numbers along with services running on it to determine the type, version and function of a specific device. There are a lot of open source tools that you can used to perform this technique. Though it may look like simple and ordinary technique, it may be used for both good and bad intentions.

What can you find during a network scanning activity?

  - Open ports
  - Services installed and it's functions
  - Operating System and it's version 
  - Vulnerable services
  - Computer names
  - Filtering devices
  - Shared folders
  - Applications installed

Now we know that network scanning technique can be used for either good and bad intentions, let's see how these actors use network scanning:

  - **Attackers/cybercriminals**

    For attackers and cyber criminals, they use network scanning to perform reconnaissance on certain target network. Looking for devices that are running outdated versions of services and applications can be considered as vulnerable and a possible entry point to get access to the network and it's resources. 
    
  - **Administrators**
  
    Administrators use network scanning technique to perform maintenance and verifying security policy.  
  
  - **Auditors**
    
    Auditors both act as an attacker in a sense that we find possible vulnerabilities present on a network and attempt verify the vulnerability if it really exists, and as an administrator documenting findings and discovered outdated and non-compliant systems and provide recommendation and solution to the vulnerabilities they discover.


**Local Network Environment**

Local networks often have a variety of devices connected to them - servers, user devices such as cellphones, tablets, laptops and printers. Scanning the connected devices can reveal potential areas for further research such as odd ports being open, out of date devices/services, forgotten servers/services etc. These information are then reviewed in vulnerability research exercise, and then (if required) validated in the penetration testing exercise. 


**Public Network Environment**

Selected scanning of external network devices (websites, webmail, extranet services) may also reveal vulnerabilities or other areas of concern. However, it is important that you seek approval or any written document that proves you have the authority to scan your target organization along with its web resources and services.
