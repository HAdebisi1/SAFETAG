* Brainstorm with staff all of the organizational processes
  - Try to make sure that everyone is present as the processes mapping involves them who use the process.
  - They're the best people to tell you what the issues are
  - They're the ones who are at stake

* Identify a smaller sets of processes which are mission critical
  - Communicating with sources
  - Sending sensitive information to colleauges and 3rd party organizations
  - Investigative journalism online
  - Access to organizational resources (e.g., Organizational funds, social media accounts, banking etc) 

* Finish the process mapping first - take note and park the discussions of improvements after 
  - It is common for participants to resolve issues, discuss exceptions and errors during the activity
  - Map the basic process first, then go back the exceptions and errors. You can't prioritize until you have the whole picture 
  - Completely mapping interactions and events that compose a process will lead you to the areas that are expose to risks

* Put everything in a drawing board
  - Modifying & changing a flow in a process is easy and more chance to change. It can also make the participants interactive.
  - Slides looks formal and official, and somehow difficult to change and modify

If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches described in the [Remote Facilitation](#appendix-remote-facilitation) appendix.
