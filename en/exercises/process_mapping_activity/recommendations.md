Process mapping is simply documenting the steps in a certain process or simply an inventory of why you do the things that you do. Is is your job as an auditor to map the organization's existing process in order to achieve sound judgement in providing digital security recommendation or solution.

Remember that in any process mapping sessions, participants may bring up exceptions and errors. Then, integrating digital security on the process, can make things more complicated and messy. In order to manage your time effeciently and not end up discussing issues and solving them during session, you must:

1. Be firm with your goal.
    - Map out the current overall process first
    - Manage and control your audience by  limitating discussion over insignificant topics
    - List all issues and errors and review them later

2. Have the mindset of a hacker.
    - Depending on your skill level, or understanding of hacking, you should already be thinking of how you can exploit weak processes even during discussion. You must put yourself in a position of a hacker, who's goal is to identify all weakpoints in their process. If this is your way of thinking, you may already be formulating ideas on how to mitigate those attacks and give the best recommendation according to their process.
 
This activity can sometimes lead to hopelessness, or challenge; it is important to remind the staff that any risk can be mitigated, and indeed it is the goal of an audit to identify the highest priority ones based on actual likelihood and provide guidance on mitigation.
