    For high-risk organizations, or even among others, it is of best practice to keep digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops and computers turned off during the mapping activity. The use of camera, (not camera phones) is recommended. Mobile devices such as laptops and mobile phones if compromised can record audio, and capture videos.
