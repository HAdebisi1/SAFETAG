**Introduction**

According to Burp's official [documentation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783101-how-to-use-burp-suite), Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It is **not a point-and-click** tool, but is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process. With a little bit of effort, anyone can start using the core features of Burp to test the security of their applications. Some of Burp's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master. All of this investment is hugely worth it - Burp's user-driven workflow is by the far the most effective way to perform web security testing, and will take you way beyond the capabilities of any conventional point-and-click scanner. Burp is intuitive and user-friendly, and the best way to start learning is by doing. These steps will get you started with running Burp and using its basic features. You can then read on deeper into the documentation to become more proficient in using this supremely powerful tool.

Burp Suite contains various tools for performing different testing tasks. The tools operate effectively together, and you can pass interesting requests between tools as your work progresses, to carry out different actions.

* **Target** - This tool contains detailed information about your target applications, and lets you drive the process of testing for vulnerabilities.
* **Proxy** - This is an intercepting web proxy that operates as a man-in-the-middle between the end browser and the target web application. It lets you intercept, inspect and modify the raw traffic passing in both directions.
* **Spider** - This is an intelligent application-aware web spider that can crawl an application to locate its content and functionality.
* **Scanner [Pro version]** - This is an advanced web vulnerability scanner, which can automatically discover numerous types of vulnerabilities.
* **Intruder** - This is a powerful tool for carrying out automated customized attacks against web applications. It is highly configurable and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks to make your testing faster and more effective.
* **Repeater** - This is a simple tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests, and analyzing the application's responses.
* **Sequencer** - This is a sophisticated tool for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application's session tokens or other important data items that are intended to be unpredictable.
* **Decoder** - This is a useful tool for performing manual or intelligent decoding and encoding of application data.
* **Comparer** - This is a handy utility for performing a visual "diff" between any two items of data, such as pairs of similar HTTP messages.
* **Extender** - This lets you load Burp extensions, to extend Burp's functionality using your own or third-party code.


**Getting Started**
**NOTE from the official documentation:** *Using Burp Suite may result in unexpected effects in some applications. Until you are fully familiar with its functionality and settings, you should only use Burp Suite against non-production systems.*

**Launching Burp**

Burp Suite is a Java application and is distributed as a standalone Java executable file, with the .JAR extension. The Burp JAR file can be executed using a Java Runtime Environment, and there is no need to unpack the contents of the JAR file itself.

To launch Burp, first check whether Java is installed:

Open a command prompt:

 - On Windows, click the Start button, type ```cmd``` into the search box, and click on the ```cmd.exe``` item under "Programs".
 - On Mac OS X, in the system dock, click on Applications, then Utilities, then Terminal.app.
 - On Linux, look in your lists of applications for an item called ```console``` or ```shell```.

In the command prompt window, type:
```
java -version
```
If Java is installed, you will see a message like: ```java version "1.6.0_21"```. To run Burp, you will need a version of Java that is 1.6 or later.

If Java is not installed, or if your version of Java is older than 1.6, you will need to install Java. [Download the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), run the installer, and then open a new command prompt and start again.

 With Java installed, on some platforms you may be able to run Burp directly by double-clicking the Burp JAR file. However, it is preferable to launch Burp from the command line, as this gives you more control over its execution, in particular the amount of memory that your computer assigns to Burp. To do this, in your command prompt type a command like:
```
java -jar -Xmx1024m /path/to/burp.jar
```
where 1024 is the amount of memory (in Mb) that you want to assign to Burp, and /path/to/burp.jar is the location of the Burp JAR file on your computer.

If everything is working, a splash screen should display for a few seconds, and then the main startup wizard window should appear. If nothing happens, or if an error message appears, please refer to the [troubleshooting help](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_troubleshooting.html).
