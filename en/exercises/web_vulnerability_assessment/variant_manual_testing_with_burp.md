**Introduction**

According to Burp's official [documentation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783101-how-to-use-burp-suite), Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It is **not a point-and-click** tool, but is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process. With a little bit of effort, anyone can start using the core features of Burp to test the security of their applications. Some of Burp's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master. 

All of this investment is hugely worth it - Burp's user-driven workflow is by the far the most effective way to perform web security testing, and will take you way beyond the capabilities of any conventional point-and-click scanner. Burp is intuitive and user-friendly, and the best way to start learning is by doing. These steps will get you started with running Burp and using its basic features. You can then read on deeper into the documentation to become more proficient in using this supremely powerful tool.

Burp Suite contains various tools for performing different testing tasks. The tools operate effectively together, and you can pass interesting requests between tools as your work progresses, to carry out different actions.

To know more about BurpSuite's other tools and features, visit BurpSuite's [Tools](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burptools) and it's [functions](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_functions) pages.

**Requirements**

Note: If you are using Kali Linux, you already have Burpsuite pre-installed. Otherwise if you do not have a Linux box, refer to the following requirements below:

- Windows/MAC OSX (Kali Linux Preferred)
- [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)  
- Browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))
- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)


**Launching Burp**

With Java installed, on some platforms you may be able to run Burp directly by double-clicking the Burp JAR file. However, it is preferable to launch Burp from the command line, as this gives you more control over its execution, in particular the amount of memory that your computer assigns to Burp. To do this, in your command prompt type a command like:

```
java -jar -Xmx1024m /path/to/burp.jar
```

where 1024 is the amount of memory (in Mb) that you want to assign to Burp, and /path/to/burp.jar is the location of the Burp JAR file on your computer.

If everything is working, a splash screen should display for a few seconds, and then the main startup wizard window should appear. If nothing happens, or if an error message appears, please refer to the [troubleshooting help](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_troubleshooting.html).


**Setting up your environment**

- Verifying Scope/Target:
      - Always check that you have the right URL/Domain before starting. Last thing we wanted to happen is to scan a different target that is out of our scope!

- Setting up your browser

   - For Firefox:
     - Paste ```about:preferences#advanced``` this in your URL, and click ```Settings``` left of **Connection**
     - Click ```Manual proxy configuration``` and enter ```localhost``` under **HTTP Proxy**, with Port set to: ```8080```
     - Check ```Use this proxy server for all protocols```
     
   - For Chrome:
     - Paste ```chrome://settings/system``` then click **Open proxy Settings**
     - This will open the **Network Setting* windows in Kali. Click **Network proxy** and set *Method* to ```Manual```
      - Set **HTTP Proxy** to ```127.0.0.1``` with **Port** valued at ```8080```
      - Configure the rest of settings with following values above (HTTPS, FTP Proxies, and Socks Host)

- Setting up Socks Proxy (Optional)
   - In some cases, you will be required to scan from an approved testing environment or a specific network/IP range. In this case, you have to configure Socks Proxy for your assessment.
   - Verify your IP. Take note of your current IP address. ([WhatismyIP.com](http://whatismyip.com/))
   - To setup your Socks Proxy, we can do this by connecting via SSH to our server:
     - ```ssh –D 9292 –l username@server_name/ip``` 
   - Once authenticated, configure Burpsuite to route it's traffic to our outbound SSH tunnel.
     - From **Options** Tab, click **Connections** sub-tab and scroll down to ```Socks Proxy```
     - In **Socks Proxy host**, type ```localhost```. and under **Socks Proxy port**, type ```9292``` 
     - Then check **Use SOCKS proxy** button
   - You can again [check](http://whatismyip.com/) your IP address to verify if your configuration is correct.
