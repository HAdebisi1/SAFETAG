The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work & personal).  The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what "red flags" they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.

As you work with staff members, also interview them about the other devices they use such as phones and tablets, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, chat Apps, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.

See the Appendix for a per-OS guide of where to find key data.
