Psychological Considerations

* Ask the staff to keep the stories generalised, not personalised during the organisation interview
* Staff might be embarrassed talk an incident about in front of the entire org
* Staff might exaggerate or overestimate attacks due to lack of understanding of the attack and impact
* Staff might underestimate attacks due to overexposure to these hacks, other pressing challenges, or lack of understanding
* Auditors should listen and explain concepts, but don't argue about the "seriousness" of the incident
* Don't correct the staff member if they describe the incident incorrectly
* Tread carefully, given the topic can be triggering or difficult and this is an early stage of the audit

Operational Security

* In case you do an interview online, the data needs to be protected (end to end encryption, tor, vpns, etc)
* Get the consent of the participant to speak with them over that channel, or add details about the VOIP application and privacy information to the agreement
* Might consider not having the conversation in the office, but somewhere trusted
* Might want to leave devices outside of the room

Other Considerations

* The auditor isn't here to fix or investigate the issue, but to collect data and pull out insights that will shape the audit.
* Be aware of time and don't spend too much time on explaining what advanced threats are
* Before starting the interview process, read about known or common attacks that you can reference to remind staff and get the conversation started. In order for the stories to be compelling, they should be localised and the threats should reflect common challenges in their line of work. Compile a story for each of the following ATs:
  * DDoS attack
  * Website defacement
  * Malware
  * Phishing
  * Blackmail - Electronic Threats
  * Ransomware
