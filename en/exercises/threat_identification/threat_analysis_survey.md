#### Calculative Impact Identification 
 
|Threat type|Impact|Likelihood|Risk|
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
|**HUMAN THREATS**|||||
|1. Accidental destruction, modification, disclosure of confidential information|||||
|2. Ignorance: inadequate security awareness, lack of security guidelines, lack of proper documentation, lack of knowledge|||||
|3. Workload: Too many or too few system administrators, highly pressured users|||||
|4. Users may inadvertently give information on security weaknesses to attackers|||||
|5. Incorrect system configuration|||||
|6. Inadequate security policy|||||
|7. Dishonesty: Fraud, theft, selling of confidential information|||||
|8. Attackers may use telephone to impersonate employees to persuade users/administrators to give user name/passwords, etc|||||
||||||
|**GENERAL THREATS**|||||
|1. Unauthorized use of “logged-in” computers|||||
|2. Installation of unauthorized software or hardware|||||
|3. Denial of service, due to Website traffic, large PING packets, etc.|||||
|4. Malware in programs, documents, e-mail attachments, etc|||||
||||||
|**IDENTIFICATION AUTHORIZATION THREATS**|||||
|1. Attack software masquerading as normal programs (Trojan horses)|||||
|2. Attack hardware masquerading as normal commercial hardware|||||
|3. External attackers masquerading as valid users|||||
|4. Internal attackers masquerading as valid users|||||
||||||
|**PRIVACY THREATS**|||||
|1. Telephone eavesdropping (via telephone bugs, inductive sensors, or service providers|||||
|2. Electromagnetic eavesdropping |||||
|3. Rubbish eavesdropping (analyzing waste for confidential documents, etc.)|||||
|4. Planted bugs in the building |||||
||||||
|**INTEGRITY/ACCURACY THREATS**|||||
|1. Deliberate damage of information by external source|||||
|2. Deliberate damage of information by internal sources|||||
|3. Deliberate modification of information|||||
||||||
|**ACCESS CONTROL THREATS**|||||
|1. Password cracking (access to password files, use of default/weak passwords, etc)|||||
|2. External access to password files, and sniffing of the networks|||||
|3. Unsecured maintenance of online services, developer backdoors|||||
|4. Bugs in network software which can open unknown/unexpected security holes (holes can be exploited from externally to gain access)|||||
|5. Unauthorized physical access to system|||||
||||||
|**LEGAL THREATS**|||||
|1. Failure to comply with legal requirements|||||
|2. Liability for acts of internal users or attackers who abuse the system to perpetrate unlawful acts (ie, incitement to racism, gambling, money laundering, distribution of pornographic or violent material)|||||
|3. Liability for damages if an internal user attacks other sites|||||
||||||
|**RELIABILITY OF SERVICE THREATS**|||||
|1. Major natural disasters, fire, water, earthquake, floods, power outages, etc|||||
|2. Minor natural disasters, of short duration, or causing little damage|||||
|3. Equipment failure from defective hardware, cabling, or communications system.|||||
|4 Denial of Service due to network abuse: Misuse of routing protocols to confuse and mislead systems|||||
|5. Downloading of malicious Applets, Active X controls, macros, PostScript files, etc through the browsers|||||
|6. Sabotage: Physical destruction of network interface devices, cables|||||




**Risk = Impact * Likelihood**

##### SCALE
|Impact Scale|Likelihood|
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|Impact is negligible =1|Unlikely to occur =0||||
|Effect is minor, major organization operations are not affected=2| Likely to occur less than once per year =1||||
|Organization operations are unavailable for a certain amount of time, costs are incurred. Public/customer confidence is minimally affected =3| Likely to occur once per year =2||||
|Significant loss of operations, significant impact on public/customer confidence =4| likely to occur once per month =3||||
|Effect is disastrous, systems are down for an extended period of time, rebuilding and replacement of systems is required =5| Likely to occur once per week =4||||
|Effect is catastrophic, critical systems are completely down for an extended period; data is lost or irreparably corrupted; public and customers are totally affected =6| Likely to occur daily =5||||
