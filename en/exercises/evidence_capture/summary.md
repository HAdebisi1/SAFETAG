This component  describes how to acquire and handle data from a device (laptop, desktop, HDD, memory stick, USB stick, etc.) to perform an analysis without altering the evidence. Any alteration, or even an environment or situation that creates the possibility of alteration, could lead to rejection of the evidence in a court of law or to malware analysis failures. This component briefs the tools and procedures required to acquire the image (live or dead, depending on the situation) that is needed to perform a malware analysis or forensic evidence  process.
