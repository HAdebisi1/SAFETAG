# Introduction

The Security Auditing Framework and Evaluation Template for Advocacy Groups (SAFETAG) is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to small, non-profit, human rights organizations based or operating in the developing world.

SAFETAG is based upon a set of principles, activities, and best practices to allow digital security auditors to best support at-risk organizations by working with them to identify the risks they face, the next steps they need to take to address them, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.

The Minimal Viable Audit is designed as the starting point for an assessment to be considered viable under the SAFETAG framework. It primarily focuses on identification of possible threats in and to the organization, its capacity to deal with them, data management and organizational device usuage. It is intended to be used where time for the assessment is very limited and where assessor/audit is needs a starting point. 
For a more comprehesive assessment, use of the full SAFETAG guide and other tools will be required.
